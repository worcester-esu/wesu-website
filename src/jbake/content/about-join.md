New members are always welcome, whether you've been in Scouting for years or are a complete newcomer. It should go without saying that we're open to everyone (aged 14 to 18 of course - if you're under 14 or over 18, one of Scouting's [other sections](http://scouts.org.uk/what-we-do/scouting-age-ranges/) will be glad to welcome you).

If you're already a Scout, your Scout Leader should talk to you about moving up when you're approaching 14. You can move up as early as 13½, or stay in Scouts until 14½. Similar to other sections, you'll attend both Scout and Explorer meetings for a few weeks before you're invested into the Unit.

If you're not a Scout, just [get in touch](contact.html), and we'll get back to you with details of upcoming meetings.
