Everyone's welcome at Explorers. It doesn't matter whether you started years ago in Beavers or you only heard about Scouting last week.

You'll come along to activities to try things out for a few weeks. Once you've got your bearings, you'll take your [promise](https://scouts.org.uk/explorers/being-an-explorer/promises-and-ceremonies/) and become a full unit member. If you're already a Scout, you'll still go to Scouts until then.

Use our [joining form](go/join) or get in touch [another way](contact.html). We'll let you know when would be a good activity to start.

## Not aged 14 to 18?

One of the other sections in [Scouts Worcester](http://www.worcesterscouts.org/) will be glad to welcome you. If you're over 18, you could also think about [volunteering](volunteer.html) as a leader.
