Young Leaders are Explorers who lead a younger section alongside adults.

This helps us learn skills for life - thinking on our feet, mucking in and leading other people - and lets us give something back to the Scouts at the same time. It also helps us work towards our awards.

Some Young Leaders also go to one of the regular [Explorer units](about-sections.html), some don't.
