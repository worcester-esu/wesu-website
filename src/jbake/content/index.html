<p>We help 14- to 18-year-olds in and around Worcester to think for themselves, stand on their own two feet and give things a go. To become do-ers and leaders, and basically learn the skills they need for life.</p>
<p>We're Scouts and everyone's welcome here. We run activities on weeknights and plenty more besides: from axe throwing to backwoods cooking, rock climbing to first aid training, camping to wide games.</p>
