Our members work towards a variety of badges and awards.


## Chief Scout's Awards

The core awards in Explorers are the [Chief Scout's Platinum Award](https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/363/chief-scouts-platinum-award/?cat=9,88,125&amp;moduleID=10), the [Chief Scout's Diamond Award](https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=9,88,125,683), and finally the [Queen's Scout Award](https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=9,88,125,155).

These involve taking part in different activities in your own time over several months, as well as an expedition and a few other things.


## Duke of Edinburgh's Awards

We're also a provider of the [Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme](http://www.dofe.org/), widely recognised by employers and universities among others. It fits closely with the Chief Scout's Awards so that most of the work that you do towards one can also count towards the other.


## Young Leader Belt

Young Leaders gain various badges for completing training modules and missions. The top award, for completing all modules and all missions, is the Young Leader Belt.


## Activity Badges

There are also many Activity Badges for individual interests. These include the [Explorer Activity Badges](https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=9,88,783) as well as the [Staged Activity Badges](https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=9,88,784).

It can be difficult to run these for everyone at our weekly meetings because everyone's interests differ, but if you''re interested in working towards one just speak to your leader.
