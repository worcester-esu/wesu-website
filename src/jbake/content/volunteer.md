At Explorers, we're all volunteers. We help people become do-ers and leaders. We help people give things a go and think for themselves.

We could do a lot more - make a bigger difference - with more help.

We don't need expert knot tyers and map readers. They're useful skills once in a while, but we can teach you if and when. Most of all we need people who can be brave enough to let go, to let the Explorers figure things out for themselves and make their own mistakes.

Not to mention all the other jobs which keep things moving in the background; like organising events or looking after equipment.

Can you, or do you know anyone who could help? [Get in touch](contact.html)
