We're 14- to 18-year-old [Scouts](https://scouts.org.uk) in and around [Worcester City](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Worcester&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=52.8382,-2.327815&amp;sspn=9.829816,25.554199&amp;oq=worce&amp;hnear=Worcester,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=13).

At explorers, it's about doing our own thing. Our members decide what we do, and run a lot of it ourselves - with leaders on hand to help, of course. Along the way, we have fun, we learn to plan and to lead, to think for ourselves, and lots of other skills for life. It's not just [knots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjQMYIZOGng), woggles, shorts and hiking!
