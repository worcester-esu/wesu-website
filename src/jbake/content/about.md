We're the section of Scouting for 14 to 18-year-olds in [Worcester City](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Worcester&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=52.8382,-2.327815&amp;sspn=9.829816,25.554199&amp;oq=worce&amp;hnear=Worcester,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=m&amp;z=13) and nearby villages in the UK. We have over 110 members and run weekly activities plus lots of camps and other activities.


## What is Scouting?

Probably not what you think... it's not just knots, woggles, shorts and hiking! Well OK, we do do [knotting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjQMYIZOGng) occasionally, but that's not the whole story...

We're an international movement that uses fun and challenging [activities](about-activities.html) to support young peoples' personal development. Our members decide our programme which includes a mix of adventure, life skills and creativity as well as traditional Scouting skills.


## How does Explorers Work?

From age 14 onwards, Scouting is organised slightly differently. Instead of being part of individual Scout Groups, we have five Explorer sections which between them cover [Worcester District](http://www.worcesterscouts.org.uk/).

Each section runs its own weekly programme, but we work closely together (and with local Groups) to organise regular joint activities on a variety of weekday evenings and at weekends.


## What does it Cost?

Subscription fees are £12.50 each month; this covers the cost of most weekly meetings, insurance and ongoing running costs. Some activities and camps are extra to this, for example a weekend camp might be £30 or a week-long Summer camp might be £175.
